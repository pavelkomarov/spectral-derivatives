    "Due to the relationship between the Chebyshev and Fourier bases, there are two major ways to take a derivative in the Chebyshev basis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Via Fourier basis  \n",
    "   a. Sample the function at Chebyshev points and then pretend you're actually equisampling in a different domain, $\\theta$ instead of $x$.  \n",
    "   b. Transfrom via DCT to get to frequency domain $\\omega$.  \n",
    "   c. Multiply by appropriate $jk$ as when taking Fourier-spectral derivatives.  \n",
    "   d. Transform back to $\\theta$ domain with DCT or DST, depending on evenness or oddness of derivative order.  \n",
    "   e. Transform back to the $x$ domain via complicated mapping, derived with chain rule.  \n",
    "   f. Treat the endpoints carefully, because the transform from $\\theta$ to $x$ can't be solved explicitly at $\\pm 1$.  \n",
    "2. Via [series coefficient rule](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/44939/chebyshev-series-derivative-in-terms-of-coefficients)  \n",
    "   a. Also use Chebyshev points so we can transform from function samples to Chebyshev coefficients in $O(N \\log N)$ (although you could technically use any points you like if you're willing to fit the Chebyshev polynomials in $O(N^2)$).  \n",
    "   d. DCT and do some additional O(N) divisions to get said coefficients.  \n",
    "   c. Use the derivative rule to get Chebyshev coefficients of the derivative function in Chebyshev series representation.  \n",
    "   d. Do some additional O(N) multiplications to make DCT coefficients from Chebyshev coefficients and DCT to get function samples in $O(N \\log N)$ (or evaluate the function at any points you like in $O(N^2)$).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In [On the Errors Incurred Calculating Derivatives Using Chebyshev Polynomials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021999192902743) the athors first go through method 2 but find that \"Tight coupling between coefficients enaboes propagation of errors from high frequency to low frequency modes.\" They then explore method 1, which up until the mapping from $\\theta$ back to $x$ has cleaner separation of modes as in the Fourier case. However, [division by powers of $\\sqrt{1-x^2}$](https://pavelkomarov.com/spectral-derivatives/math.pdf) then blows up any noise or inexactness in the representation of the function at the edges of the domain ($x \\rightarrow \\pm 1$). They suggest a third method, which I've found to be no better, covered below."

    "## Implementation of Method 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the original method in `spec_deriv.py`, because it's essentially the method suggested by [Trefethen](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/epdf/10.1137/1.9780898719598.ch8). I've extended this method significantly in [my own analysis](https://pavelkomarov.com/spectral-derivatives/math.pdf) and spill quite a bit of ink over it, which I've decided to keep for sake of completeness and intuition. Best to keep the code for reference and comparison to other methods."

    "For an explanation see the [series-to-series differentation](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/chebyshev_series_based_derivatives.ipynb) notebook. For a complete implementation of this method, see [`spec_deriv.py`](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/specderiv/specderiv.py). I've chosen this method to live in the library code, because it is the simplest and shortest to read, write, and understand, comes with other benefits like allowing arbitrary $x$ points (if you're willing to suffer $O(N^2)$ work), and it works essentially numerically identically to Method 1, [even in the presence of noise](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/filtering_noise.ipynb), which is maybe surprising."

    "## Method 3\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of [On the Errors Incurred Calculating Derivatives Using Chebyshev Polynomials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021999192902743) suggest writing the function to be differentiated, which I'll call $y$ for consistency with myself, as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y(x) = \\frac{1+x}{2}y(1) + \\frac{1-x}{2}y(-1) + (1-x^2)g(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that as $x \\rightarrow 1$ the rightmost two terms disappear, and we're left with $y(1)$, and similarly for the other end of the domain, so this is a valid representation. We can now take a derivative to find:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y'(x) = \\frac{y(1) - y(-1)}{2} + \\underbrace{(1-x^2)}_{w(x)}g'(x) + \\underbrace{-2x}_{w'(x)} g(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Their claim is that the errors at the edges of the domain accrued in the differentiation process to find $g'$ are now somewhat damped by the weighting term $1-x^2$. However, notice that if all we have to start with is $y$, and $y$ is *numerical* rather than analytic, containing some kind of noise, then when we find $g$ by algebraically manipulating the first equation, we'll end up having to divide by $1-x^2$, which will blow up noise from the edges of $y$. Not great.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we substitute $g$ in terms of $y$ back in to $y'$ we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y'(x) = \\frac{y(1) - y(-1)}{2} + w(x)g'(x) + \\frac{w'(x)}{w(x)} \\Big( \\frac{y(x) - \\frac{1+x}{2}y(1) - \\frac{1-x}{2}y(-1)}{1-x^2} \\Big)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So really in order to shrink any blowup in both $g'$ and $g$, we need both $w$ and $\\frac{w'}{w}$ to go to zero at the domain edges. This turns out to be impossible. Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{w'(x)}{w(x)} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln(w(x)) =: h'(x) $$\n",
    "$$ w(x) \\rightarrow 0 \\iff h(x) = \\ln(w(x)) \\rightarrow -\\infty$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need $h$ to go to $-\\infty$ while $h'$ goes to 0, i.e. approach negative infinity with zero slope. This is possible on an infinite interval, but we are on the finite interval $[-1, 1]$, so no such $h$ can exist and therefore no such $w$. $\\blacksquare$\n",
    "\n",
    "This fundamental limitation is unfortunate but not completely unexpected, since uniform sample uncertainty $\\Delta y$ over closer and closer samples $\\Delta x \\rightarrow \\epsilon $ will fundamentally cause a blowup in $\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an additional wrinkle caused by $w$ going to 0 at the domain edges, which makes it impossible to evaluate $g$ directly there. The authors reassure us that if $w$ is polynomial we can use orthogonality of Chebyshev polynomials to set up a system of equations to solve for the endpoints, but this is annoying.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since they *do not* touch on intentionally *filtering* noise by culling high-frequency modes, I wondered whether this method could indeed improve upon the others and coded it up."
