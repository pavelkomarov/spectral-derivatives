    "# Solving for the Chebyshev-Based Spectral Derivative at Domain Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a major problem in the expanded, \"splintered\" expressions for $\\frac{d^\\nu}{dx^\\nu} y(\\theta)$: Factors in $x$ multiplying each $y{(\\nu)} = \\frac{d^\\nu}{d\\theta^\\nu}$ have multiples of $\\sqrt{1-x^2}$ in their denominators, making them undefined for $x = \\pm 1$. We can solve for the endpoints using a L'Hôpital's rule, but the answers are difficult to derive, especially for higher derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "I opened [Issue #1](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/issues/1) to address the ugliness of this with a programmatic solution. An algorithm to derive the endpoint expressions turns out to be pretty challenging, not so easy to turn into compact code, and unfortunately relies on symbolic differentiation and simplification. As such, it has not been put in to the core library code. However, in case anyone should need to take a derivative beyond the $4^{th}$, this notebook implements a process to find the right expressions."

These derivatives are pretty ugly, because $\\frac{d\\theta}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\cos^{-1}(x) = \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}$. However, due to the relationship $x = \\cos(\\theta)$, $\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \\frac{-1}{\\sin(\\theta)}$. To avoid taking the limit of a quantity with multiple related variables, it's somewhat cleaner to put everything in terms of $\\theta$ and then apply L'Hôpital's rule by taking derivatives w.r.t. $\\theta$ rather than $x$. The two are equivalent; we end up with powers of $\\sin(\\theta)$ in the denominator, which is also stubbornly 0 at the endpoints ($\\theta = 0$ and $\\pi$)."

It's like a Law of Nature, and I'm not sure exactly why. Then the last derivative entails no product rule, only shifts the constant coefficients of the odd derivatives to the next-highest even derivatives. So we can really stop the iteration one short."
