# Code Usage and Experiments

| Notebook | What's in it |
| --- | --- |
| [Alternative Chebyshev Derivative Methods](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/alternative_chebyshev_derivative_methods.ipynb) | There are multiple routes to the Chebyshev-spectral derivative. This notebook preserves, discusses, and compares them all. |
| [Arbitrary Domains](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/arbitrary_domains.ipynb) | This is where I first worked out how to take derivatives of functions over non-canonical domains (i.e. *not* $[-1, 1]$ with the Chebyshev basis or $[0, 2\pi)$ with the Fourier basis. The explanation now also lives in [the math](https://pavelkomarov.com/spectral-derivatives/math.pdf), but the interactive code example lives here.|
| [Chebyshev](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/chebyshev.ipynb) | Usage examples of `cheb_deriv`, in one and multiple dimensions, including a PDE simulation at the end.|
| [Chebyshev Antiderivatives](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/chebyshev_antiderivatives.ipynb) | It's easy to take spectral antiderivatives with the Fourier basis by simply dividing by $jk$ instead of multiplying. This notebook explores doing the same with the Chebyshev basis, as part of a resolution to [Issue #11](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/issues/11).|
| [Chebyshev Domain Endpoints](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/chebyshev_domain_endpoints.ipynb) (obsoleted by the [series-based derivative rule](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/alternative_chebyshev_derivative_methods.ipynb)) | Doing L'HÃ´pital's rule by hand to evaluate the endpoints is tedious and error-prone, so I wanted [a way to do it programmatically](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/issues/1). This notebook represents a solution based on `sympy`. It also preserves some explantion of what a nightmare it would be to try doing this in multiple dimensions simultaneously.|
| [DCT Types Comparison and Derivatives](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/dct_types_comparison_and_derivatives.ipynb) | There are several variants of the DCT. This notebook covers sampling and reconstruction of several test functions with different choices of $N$ and DCT type, then works out out exactly how to take derivatives with the the DCT-I/DST-I and DCT-II/III/DST-III and applies these methods to the test functions. The [DCT-II does best at reconstructing functions with sharp edges](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/96172/why-does-the-dct-ii-have-better-energy-compaction-than-dct-i), because it provides "wiggle room", however the DCT-I does best for cosine-sampled functions, which have flat edges.|
| [DFT, DCT, DST Relationships](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/dft_dct_dst_relationships.ipynb) | Due to aliasing, it's possible to find the DFT coefficients with many different combinations of wavenumbers, so long as they cover $\{0, ...N\}$ modulo $N$. The first part of this notebook demonstrates this in code. The second part gives explicit formulae and code examples to show how the coefficients of DCT and DST variants are related to DFT coefficients. A mathematical derivation of a couple of these relationships lives in [the math](https://pavelkomarov.com/spectral-derivatives/math.pdf), but it's useful to see others too and have a quick reference.|
| [Filtering Noise](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/filtering_noise.ipynb) | Discussion of noise and how it can be handled, with experiments to show how the Fourier and Chebyshev spectral methods hold up in the presence of noise and elucidate fundamental limitations.|
| [Fourier](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/fourier.ipynb) | Usage examples of `fourier_deriv`, in one and multiple dimensions, with an emphasis of when this method will work and when it will break.|
| [Fourier Periodic Extensions](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/fourier_periodic_extensions.ipynb) | It's sometimes possible to take even and odd extensions of a function and produce something periodic or nearly periodic, which can then be spectrally differentiated with the Fourier basis. This notebook demonstrates how to do this.|
