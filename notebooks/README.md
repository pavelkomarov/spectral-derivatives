# Code Usage and Experiments

| Notebook | What's in it |
| --- | --- |
| Arbitrary Domains | This is where I first worked out how to take derivatives of functions over non-canonical domains (i.e. *not* $[-1, 1]$ with the Chebyshev basis or $[0, 2\pi)$ with the Fourier basis. The explanation now also lives in [the math](https://pavelkomarov.com/spectral-derivatives/math.pdf), but the interactive code example lives here.|
| Chebyshev | Usage examples of `cheb_deriv`, in one and multiple dimensions, including a PDE simulation at the end.|
| Chebyshev Antiderivatives | It's easy to take spectral antiderivatives with the Fourier basis by simply dividing by $jk$ instead of multiplying. This notebook explores doing the same with the Chebyshev basis, as part of a resolution to [Issue #11](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/issues/11).|
| Chebyshev Domain Endpoints | Doing L'HÃ´pital's rule by hand to evaluate the endpoints is tedious and error-prone, so I wanted [a way to do it programmatically](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/issues/1). This notebook represents a solution. If the user tries to take derivatives over $4^{th}$ order, a warning directs them here.|
| DCT Types Comparison | Curious about other variants of the DCT, I did some sampling and reconstruction on a function with varying $N$. The [DCT-II did best](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/96172/why-does-the-dct-ii-have-better-energy-compaction-than-dct-i), which spawned [Issue #13](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/issues/13)|
| DCT Types Extension Experiments | This is where I worked out exactly how to take derivatives with the DCT-II/III and DST-III rather than the DCT-I and DST-I and poked around to find limitations. The correct path now lives in [the math](https://pavelkomarov.com/spectral-derivatives/math.pdf), but the intuition of the limitations best given by example here.|
| DFT, DCT, DST Relationship | Explicit formulae and code examples to show how the coefficients of DCT and DST variants are related to DFT coefficients. A mathematical derivation of a couple of these relationships lives in [the math](https://pavelkomarov.com/spectral-derivatives/math.pdf), but it's useful to see others too and have a quick reference.|
| DFT Play | Due to aliasing, it's possible to find the DFT coefficients with many different combinations of wavenumbers, so long as they cover $\{0, ...N\}$ modulo $N$. Here lies some code to demonstrate this fact.|
| Fourier | Usage examples of `fourier_deriv`, in one and multiple dimensions, with an emphasis of when this method will work and when it will break.|
| Fourier Periodic Extensions | It's possible to take even and odd extensions of a function and produce something periodic or nearly periodic, on which we can then spectrally differentiate with the Fourier basis. This notebook demonstrates how to do this.|
