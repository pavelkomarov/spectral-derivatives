# Code Usage and Experiments

| Notebook | What's in it |
| --- | --- |
| [Arbitrary Domains](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/arbitrary_domains.ipynb) | This is where I first worked out how to take derivatives of functions over non-canonical domains (i.e. *not* $[-1, 1]$ with the Chebyshev basis or $[0, 2\pi)$ with the Fourier basis. The explanation now also lives in [the math](https://pavelkomarov.com/spectral-derivatives/math.pdf), but the interactive code example lives here.|
| [Chebyshev](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/chebyshev.ipynb) | Usage examples of `cheb_deriv`, in one and multiple dimensions, including a PDE simulation at the end.|
| [Chebyshev Antiderivatives](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/chebyshev_antiderivatives.ipynb) | It's easy to take spectral antiderivatives with the Fourier basis by simply dividing by $jk$ instead of multiplying. This notebook explores doing the same with the Chebyshev basis, as part of a resolution to [Issue #11](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/issues/11).|
| [Chebyshev Domain Endpoints](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/chebyshev_domain_endpoints.ipynb) | Doing L'HÃ´pital's rule by hand to evaluate the endpoints is tedious and error-prone, so I wanted [a way to do it programmatically](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/issues/1). This notebook represents a solution. If the user tries to take derivatives over $4^{th}$ order, a warning directs them here.|
| [DCT Types Comparison](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/dct_types_comparison.ipynb) | Curious about other variants of the DCT, I did some sampling and reconstruction on a function with varying $N$. The [DCT-II did best](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/96172/why-does-the-dct-ii-have-better-energy-compaction-than-dct-i), which spawned [Issue #13](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/issues/13)|
| [DCT Types Extension Experiments](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/dct_types_extension_experiments.ipynb) | This is where I worked out exactly how to take derivatives with the DCT-II/III and DST-III rather than the DCT-I and DST-I and poked around to find limitations. The correct path now lives in [the math](https://pavelkomarov.com/spectral-derivatives/math.pdf), but the intuition of the limitations best given by example here.|
| [DFT, DCT, DST Relationship](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/dft_dct_dst_relationship.ipynb) | Explicit formulae and code examples to show how the coefficients of DCT and DST variants are related to DFT coefficients. A mathematical derivation of a couple of these relationships lives in [the math](https://pavelkomarov.com/spectral-derivatives/math.pdf), but it's useful to see others too and have a quick reference.|
| [DFT Play](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/dft_play.ipynb) | Due to aliasing, it's possible to find the DFT coefficients with many different combinations of wavenumbers, so long as they cover $\{0, ...N\}$ modulo $N$. Here lies some code to demonstrate this fact.|
| [Filtering Noise](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/filtering_noise.ipynb) | |
| [Fourier](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/fourier.ipynb) | Usage examples of `fourier_deriv`, in one and multiple dimensions, with an emphasis of when this method will work and when it will break.|
| [Fourier Periodic Extensions](https://github.com/pavelkomarov/spectral-derivatives/blob/main/notebooks/fourier_periodic_extensions.ipynb) | It's sometimes possible to take even and odd extensions of a function and produce something periodic or nearly periodic, which can then be spectrally differentiated with the Fourier basis. This notebook demonstrates how to do this.|
